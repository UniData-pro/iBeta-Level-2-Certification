# iBeta Level 2 Dataset: Presentation Attacks Liveness Detection & Verifications
The dataset consists of more than **32,300** spoofing attacks of **6** different types specifically curated for a passing **iBeta Level 2** and getting a certification. It is compliant with the **ISO 30107-3** standard, which sets the highest quality requirements for biometric testing and attack detection solutions. 

By geting the **iBeta Level 2 certification**, biometric technology companies demonstrate their commitment to developing robust and reliable biometric systems that can effectively detect and prevent fraud -
